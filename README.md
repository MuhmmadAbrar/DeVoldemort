# Personal Voice Assistant

The project is aimed at providing personal asssistance for users both visually and acoustically. 
This AI also provides a lot of services from 
saying the time to cracking jokes (if the user feels bored). It can 
also surf the internet with the help of the user’s voice command. 
The system’s microphone and speaker are used as source of input and output 
respectively. 

Key features of our project are as follows:- 

1. User Greetings: 
 Commands- Hello, Jash, How are you, Thanks, Your name? 

2. Exception handling: 
 Many users tend to play with their voice assistants by using 
some inappropriate words which are recognized and replied 
by our assistant. 

3. Wikipedia: 
 This function can be invoked by prefixing “tell me about” 
before the phrase the user actually wants to know about. 
Eg: ‘Tell me about Abdul Kalam ’ will return 2 sentences 
about Abdul Kalam from Wikipedia.com 

4. Other Functionalities: 
 Shutting down the system: Invoked by “Go to sleep” 
command. 
 Games: Invoked by “Play some games” command. 
 Time: Invoked by “What is the time now” command. 
 Joke: Invoked by “Tell me a joke” command. 
 Open websites: Invoked by suffixing ‘.com’ behind the 
website name the user wishes to open. 
 Navigation: Invoked by “open maps” command. 
 System Information: Invoked by “Show me system 
information” command.
